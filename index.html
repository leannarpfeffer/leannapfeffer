    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Leanna Pfeffer, a Research Associate in Tissue Engineering with a specialized focus on cancer biology, autoimmune models, and biomaterials. My work integrates innovative organ-on-chip technologies, immunoengineering, and regenerative medicine to develop advanced therapeutic solutions. My journey in biomedical engineering, combined with a strong foundation in cancer research and biomaterials, has driven my passion for exploring the potential of tissue-engineered implants and their interactions with the immune system.</p>
        <p>I am deeply committed to advancing the field of regenerative medicine and aspire to pursue an MD/PhD. My research interests lie in developing tissue-engineered solutions that can be implanted without triggering immune rejection or promoting tumor growth. My work with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) aims to push the boundaries of personalized medicine, creating patient-specific treatments that address the unique challenges of each case.</p>
        <p>In the future, I hope to contribute to the creation of bioengineered implants that not only restore function but also integrate seamlessly with the host's immune system, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions in complex diseases.</p>

        <h2>Key Projects</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Organ-on-Chip Model of Breast Cancer Metastasis</h3>
            <p>Developed an advanced organ-on-chip model to study breast cancer metastasis, focusing on the interaction between circulating tumor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and endothelial cells. This platform allowed for real-time observation of tumor cell migration and provided insights into the metastatic process, facilitating the identification of potential therapeutic targets to inhibit cancer spread.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Type I Diabetes Autoimmune Model on Chip</h3>
            <p>Engineered a microfluidic system that models Type I diabetes as an autoimmune disorder. This platform mimicked the human pancreatic environment, enabling the study of beta cell regeneration under various therapeutic conditions. The model provided a novel approach to evaluating the efficacy of potential drugs in preventing immune-mediated destruction of beta cells, paving the way for personalized diabetes treatments.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Bioglass Injectable Artificial Bone with Immunomodulatory Biomaterials</h3>
            <p>Designed a bioglass-based injectable artificial bone compound, incorporating immunomodulatory biomaterials to enhance regenerative outcomes. This innovative biomaterial not only promoted bone growth at the site of injection but also modulated the local immune response, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. The project highlighted the potential of using bioglass as a scaffold for tissue regeneration while minimizing immune-related complications.</p>
